## Acknowledgement

This repo was originally copied from [wkentaro/labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme.git) 
and modified to be used as a 3D point cloud annotation tool instead of an image annotation tool.
This tool was developed by myself (Brady Lowe) and a collaborator Austin Carey (auscar92 on github).

## Installation

First, you can install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
You can install labelpc with `pip install -e .` after installing the requirements.

Once installed, open the program by running `labelpc` in a terminal.
