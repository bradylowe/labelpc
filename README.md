## Acknowledgement

This repo was originally copied from [wkentaro/labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme.git) 
and modified to be used as a 3D point cloud annotation tool instead of an image annotation tool.
This tool was developed by myself (Brady Lowe) and a collaborator Austin Carey (auscar92 on github).

## Demonstration

A short demonstration video can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/jpjvWzdVLkk).
Below are some short clips from the demo video.
